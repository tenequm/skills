description: Save a live webpage as a high-fidelity PDF that preserves the original layout AND every image (including lazy-loaded ones) using the agent-browser CLI. Use this whenever the user asks to "download this page as PDF", "save this article", "archive this URL", "fetch this page for reference", or otherwise wants a local PDF of a web page that looks like the browser version. Especially important on modern JS-heavy sites (engineering blogs, Next.js sites, anything with IntersectionObserver lazy loading) where naive `chrome --headless --print-to-pdf` or a bare `agent-browser pdf` produces blank rectangles or broken-image placeholders. Trigger this skill even when the user does not name the tool - any request to capture a webpage's full visual content as a PDF on disk should pull this in. For reader-mode/article-only output (no nav, no footer, no manual trimming) prefer percollate instead - see "When NOT to use this".

# Download a webpage as a PDF (agent-browser recipe)

The naive approaches fail on modern sites:

- `chrome --headless --print-to-pdf` captures only the initial viewport's images. Anything below the fold renders as a blank rectangle.
- `agent-browser pdf` immediately after `open` has the same problem - lazy-loaded images haven't decoded yet.
- Scrolling via JS and then waiting a fixed time is also unreliable - you don't know when each image actually finished.

The fix is one async script that strips lazy-load attributes, scrolls the page to trigger any IntersectionObserver-based loaders, and `await`s every `<img>` to decode. agent-browser's `eval` waits for the returned promise to resolve before exiting, so the subsequent `pdf` command sees a fully-loaded DOM.

## The recipe

If multiple test/agent runs may share the host's agent-browser, isolate each invocation with `agent-browser --session <unique-name> ...` on every command in the pipeline. Single-user one-off captures can omit the flag and use the default session.

`--headed false` is passed on the `open` command to force headless launch even if the host's `~/.agent-browser/config.json` defaults to `"headed": true`. This avoids popping a real Chrome window on the user's desktop while an agent is working in the background. Drop the flag (or pass `--headed`) only when you specifically want to watch the run for debugging.

```bash
agent-browser --headed false open <URL>
agent-browser wait --load networkidle

agent-browser eval "(async () => {
  const sleep = ms => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms));
  ['#onetrust-banner-sdk','#onetrust-consent-sdk','.ot-sdk-container','#ot-sdk-btn-floating','[id*=cookie]','[id*=consent]','[id*=onetrust]'].forEach(s => document.querySelectorAll(s).forEach(e => e.remove()));
  document.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    img.removeAttribute('loading');
    img.removeAttribute('decoding');
    if (img.dataset.src) img.src = img.dataset.src;
    if (img.dataset.srcset) img.srcset = img.dataset.srcset;
  });
  for (let y = 0; y < document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 2000; y += 400) {
    window.scrollTo(0, y);
    await sleep(200);
  }
  window.scrollTo(0, document.documentElement.scrollHeight);
  await sleep(2000);
  await Promise.all(Array.from(document.images).map(i =>
    i.complete && i.naturalWidth ? null
    : new Promise(r => { i.addEventListener('load', r, {once:true}); i.addEventListener('error', r, {once:true}); setTimeout(r, 5000); })
  ));
  window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  await sleep(500);
  return Array.from(document.images).filter(i => !i.naturalWidth).length;
})()"

agent-browser pdf /tmp/page.pdf
agent-browser close

# Verify the result
pdfinfo /tmp/page.pdf | grep -E "Pages|File size"
```

The `eval` returns the count of images that still failed to load. Expect `0`. If non-zero, the recipe didn't fully capture the page - investigate before trusting the PDF. The `pdfinfo` line is your standard end-of-recipe report (page count + bytes) so the agent has concrete numbers to relay back.

## Why each step matters

- **`wait --load networkidle`** before the eval gives the page a chance to attach its IntersectionObservers and other JS hooks. Scrolling before observers attach defeats the trigger.
- **Removing the `loading` attribute** is the structural fix. This is the same trick percollate uses internally - the most reliable way to make Chromium eagerly fetch every image.
- **Scrolling the full height in 400px steps** triggers any observer-based loaders that watch for elements crossing the viewport. Some sites use observers even after `loading=lazy` is removed.
- **`await Promise.all` on every `<img>`** guarantees decoded pixels are in memory before the eval returns. agent-browser's `eval` is promise-aware - the next command (`pdf`) will not run until this resolves.
- **Returning the broken-image count** is your verification. If it is not 0, the recipe did not fully capture the page - do not trust the PDF.

## Cleanup pipeline (optional but recommended)

agent-browser saves at letter size with the page's full footer (nav, newsletter signup, link sitemap). For a clean archive:

```bash
# 1. Inspect total page count and visually identify which trailing pages are footer
pdfinfo /tmp/page.pdf | grep Pages

# Use the Read tool on the PDF to see the last few pages and decide where the article ends.

# 2. Trim footer pages. The "1-9" below is illustrative ONLY - replace with the
#    article's actual range from pdfinfo + visual inspection. Do not copy this verbatim.
qpdf /tmp/page.pdf --pages . 1-9 -- /tmp/page-trimmed.pdf

# 3. Compress (typically 60-70% reduction with images intact)
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook \
   -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH \
   -sOutputFile=/path/to/final.pdf /tmp/page-trimmed.pdf
```

`-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook` keeps images legible at roughly half the raw size. `/screen` is smaller but blurrier; use only when size matters more than legibility.

## When NOT to use this

- **Reader-mode / article-only output** (no nav, no footer, no manual trimming, just the article body and its images): use `npx percollate pdf <URL> -o out.pdf` instead. percollate runs Mozilla Readability + Puppeteer and auto-strips chrome. It also handles lazy-load via DOM preprocessing rather than scroll hacks. Slower (~10s) but zero trimming work and very robust on unknown URLs. Pair with `--no-hyphenate --css "@page { size: A4; margin: 18mm; } a[href]::after { content: none !important; }"` to suppress the inlined-URL-after-link default.
- **Single-page screenshot (not paginated)**: use `agent-browser screenshot --full-page` instead.
- **HTML archive with all assets bundled**: use `monolith` or `single-file CLI`. PDFs lose interactivity.
- **Server-rendered HTML you control** (no JS): WeasyPrint is faster and simpler.

## Picking between agent-browser and percollate

When the user does not specify, default to **percollate** for "save this for archival reference" - it's idiot-proof and handles unknown URLs without manual trimming. Use **agent-browser** (this skill) when the user explicitly wants the page to look like the browser version, or when the page is not article-shaped (a tool, dashboard, marketing page, portfolio) where Mozilla Readability would strip out content the user actually wants.
